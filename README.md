# Random Password Generator

This is one of my first projects (planning on adding more functionality too once I get more proficient), and I'm happy with how it turned out. I had trouble deciding how I was going to read the file for the random word password, but ultimately decided with using the CSV library. It's super basic, but it works.


**UPDATE**: I added a GUI to the project, but you can also still run it from the script file in the command line. There is also a new EXE file to run the program. (It is dependent on the files in the folder). I orginally tried with PySimpleGUI, but it didn't give results I liked so I ended up using PyQT5. 

Thank you
