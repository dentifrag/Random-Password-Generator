#This is one of my first projects (that I am planning on adding a GUI and more functionality too once I get more proficient), and I'm happy with how it turned out. I had trouble deciding how I was going to read the file for the random word password, but ultimately decided with using the CSV library. It's super basic, but it works.

Thank you
